<h2> My Backstory </h2>

COSI / SaaS

CITI / Misc UNIX / X11

IFS group / Mainframe

vs NFS

About 1989/90 asked O'Reilly about an AFS book.  Not terribly interested; wanted a DCE/DFS book.

One response, "wonder if you've backed the wrong horse? NFS?"  So what? only one programming language ?

Get to Morgan Stanley

AFS; obvious advantages

Go to UBS for DCE/DFS

Springer Verlag responds; sounds great.

Mention it to colleague, wife works for Prentice-Hall; contact, contract.

1995

Devote 3 nights a week, three hours a night.

After year and a half, 4 nights.

Revisions

illustrations

Not much support; not enough outreach on my part

Some said, make it a small book. How to do that? It's a rats nest. And who/when will other books be written??


Best part, I think, is that I was able to write a story over many chapters that made sense. 

Illustrations major fail.

One more massive editorial rewrite over 24 hours.
